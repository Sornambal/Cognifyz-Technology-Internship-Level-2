# Cognifyz-Technology-Internship-Level-2
This project explores the  restaurant dataset using Python and pandas for data preprocessing, analysis, and feature engineering. The goal is to uncover insights about restaurant operations, customer preferences, and service availability.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes information such as restaurant names, locations, ratings, cuisines, price range, and service options like table booking and online delivery.


✅ Level 2 – Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery

📌 Objective:

Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.

Compare average ratings between restaurants with and without table booking.

Analyze how online delivery availability varies with price range.

📊 Key Insights:

Calculated percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.

Visual comparison of average ratings.

Bar chart of delivery availability vs. price range.

✅ Level 2 – Task 2: Price Range Analysis

📌 Objective:

Identify the most common price range.

Compute average ratings for each price range.

Find the rating color associated with the highest average rating.

📊 Key Insights:

Mode of price range.

Grouped average rating across price categories.

Identified the rating color for the highest-rated segment.

✅ Level 2 – Task 3: Feature Engineering

📌 Objective:

Extract new features from existing columns.

Create encoded versions of categorical service-related columns.

🛠️ Features Created:

Feature Name	Description

Restaurant_Name_Length	Character length of the restaurant name

Address_Length	Character length of the restaurant address

Table_Booking_Flag	1 if table booking is available, 0 otherwise

Online_Delivery_Flag	1 if online delivery is available, 0 otherwise

These engineered features can improve model input in later machine learning or analytics tasks.

📌 Tools Used

Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Data Visualization (bar plots and grouped comparisons)
